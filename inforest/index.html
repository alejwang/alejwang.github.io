						<p>People need the forest. For people who forgot already, we should let them remember the feeling of nature. </p>
						<p>Imagine if you were leisurely sauntering in a forest, taking in all the sights, sounds and smells of nature. It will the most welcome when you get tired of city’s noise. The concept of InForest originated to produce an interactive, experiential
							system arousing urban people the sensation of the forest. </p>
						<p>Our work started with analyzing the vertical structure of the forest which contributes to people’ s multi-layer sensory experience in the forest. Then we abstracted specific sounds from each layer of the following design. </p>

								<h4>urbanization + nature = ?</h4>
								<p>China is experiencing the fastest and highest urbanization in the world, which leaves many thorny nature problems like air pollution, dense traffic, and more notably increasing pressure on people. Not surprisingly, urban people are eager to get
									away from cities and get close to the wild nature without haze once they have a chance. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/inforest_screen.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>interaction = screen ?</h4>
								<p>As informative transformation goes further and more profound, whereas ubiquitous screen-based user interfaces have profoundly changed people’s lives, it is estranging people from the real physical world. This context urges me to rethink interaction
									design on a more significant scale-to design interactive system or environment where people are naturally immersed in. </p>

					<div class="9u$ -3u 12u$(medium)">
						<span class="image alt"><img src="images/inforest_principle.png" alt="" /></span>

						<p>We use the technology called Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing Technique from Disney Research and Carnegie Mellon University (Touché: Enhancing Touch Interaction on Humans, Screens, Liquids, and Everyday Objects) </p>

						<p>To build the sensing system, a single conductive wire links the soil or water to our sensor controller. Through dynamic signal analysis, the sensing system could detect and recognize people’s different interactions (e.g., approach, touch, etc.)
							with plants.</p>

				<h3>then by gestures classification experiment, <br>we selected suitable plants and <br>got valuable coefficient in results</h3>

					<div class="9u$ -3u 12u$(medium)">
						<p>Gestures classification was the next step to enhance plants with rich touch and gesture interactivity. Each transmission from the sensor contained a 160-point capacitive profile from which we extracted a series of features for classification.
						</p>
						<p>
							After more than 400 times classification accuracies tests for different kinds of plants, we select reliable controlling gestures with accuracies over 80% of each plant for the following application.

								<h4>Bird + Wind</h4>
								<p>People could control the volume of the sound of birds by changing the distance from their hands to the plants. When they touch the plants, they will hear all the birds scatter away suddenly, and they need to move to another location to listen
									to those birds singing again.</p>
							</div>

								<h4>Cicadas</h4>
								<p>On this floor, people could rest under a tree of cicadas sounds. The sound could be gradually stopped by pinching the leaves.</p>

							<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
								<h4>Crickets + Frogs</h4>
								<p>Interactive plants units are installed along the trails going upward. People would hear frogs and crickets sound when they walk on the trails and even hear frogs’ jumping into the water when they touch the plants.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<h4>Streams</h4>
								<p>The base of Inforest is an urban interactive public breathing space where people can participate. Our work taps into some of the most basic human instincts, to play and explore. It also generates talk value through a shared experience.</p>
