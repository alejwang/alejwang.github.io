						<p>Before the interviews, we prepared the protocols for interviewees to let us keep on track to learn how CiviCRM works in NZ. Two of our team members were assigned to each interview - one as designated interviewer, and one as note taker.</p>
						<p>Contextual inquiry also include observation on the users' behaviour, and even the artifacts and physical environment. We took about an hour for each interview to catch every single piece of information we can. </p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-oldDateSoftware.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>old-date software? <br>keep up-to-date! </h4>
								<p>
									CiviCRM is an open source software which is easy to customize. But it’s risky to do that because it will be hard to upgrade after changing the codes.
									<br> Our recommendation is to ensure Neutral Zone’s CiviCRM is a branch of original open source CiviCRM using user-defined keywords and flexible plugins, instead of modifying the core directly, so it can be updated as well as the original version.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">


								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-noReply.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>no reply? <br>new protocal! </h4>
								<p>
									Usually it’s a long time to receive a feedback from the developer, as well as for problems to be fixed.
									<br> Our recommendation is to create an issue-feedback process between Neutral Zone and the current tech developer.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-onePersonOnly.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>one person only? <br>hire volunteers! </h4>
								<p>
									Now NZ transfers to another person as the developer. But there’s only one person in charge.
									<br> Our recommendation is to invite developers from University of Michigan as supplementary tech support.

							It’s a little daunting...you see all this and you scroll and these fields are really big and some of them are hidden and you say ‘Do I want program rosters 15-16, where’s 16-17, it’s gone’, so there are some awkward things about using it. <br>--

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-unusableReport.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>unusable report? <br>customize it! </h4>
								<p>
									Now reports and rosters cannot be generated automatically nor meet staff's specific needs.
									<br> Our recommendation is to improve the power of filters already in CiviCRM and allow user to create customized filtered report.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-badReachability.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>bad reachability? <br>improve interface! </h4>
								<p>
									The searching ability is limited and there are too many unnecessary navigation tabs.
									<br> Our recommendation is to write a plugin for more powerful searching ability, and also reduce unnecessary navigation bars.

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-missCheckIn.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>miss check-in? <br>more scanner! </h4>
								<p>
									Teen can miss check in to the program at the entrance. And now it only allow teachers to add check-in information manually.
									<br> Our recommendation is to use more physical scanners or new app on their iPad to allow check-in in classrooms by scanning teen's QR code.

				<h3>3/ while previous users have difficult in using CiviCRM,<br> new users are not motivated to learn to use it </h3>

						<blockquote>
							People are frustrated that the system CiviCRM isn't working. <br> -- User with 3 years experiences

							It’s easier to use Excel now, I don’t really trust CiviCRM. <br> -- User with no experiences
						</blockquote>

						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/civicrm-unTrust.png" alt="" /></span>
						<h4>untrust? <br>provide help + training! </h4>
						<p>
							Now the usability issues involved to trust and relying problems. Since NZ really want to go back to work on CiviCRM easily again, we recommend that NZ should come up with some training material about CiviCRM for new employees. Offering some help tips
							on mostly used pages online may also help.
