						<p>Before the interviews, we prepared the protocols for interviewees to let us keep on track on finding out what the main issues are. During interviews, two of our team members were present. One was a designated interviewer and the other one was a note taker. We also got permission to record the conversations so we can replay afterwards. Observation was also part of interview, we asked interviewees to show us how they used the software system. Besides that, we also took a look at the space and the relevant artifacts. </p>
