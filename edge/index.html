          <p>Harmonious society is not only the harmony between people but also about man and animals. Animals, just like humans, crave happiness and fear for death. With the acceleration of urbanization, the number of pets is increasing, and the number
            of stray animals is increasing at the same time. More and more stray animals have brought about a series of social, environmental and health problems. At present, only a part of the economically developed areas in China have government-set-up
            shelters. However, these institutions are often encountered operating crisis due to the low occupancy rate, difficulty on funds, lack of social concerns and other problems.Since the site is located on the edge of the city, away from the city
            center, there is no doubt that it increases the difficulty on the operation of the shelter.</p>

      <p class="grey">The second floor of the building is released to the public as a Qiantang River sightseeing stand. Every year millions of visitors will be attracted by the Qian Tang River tide, therefore the sightseeing stand will attract huge crowds and potential
        customers for animal shelter. Walking on the trail, the sight will be effectively interacted with the hospitals on the third floor and the shelter space on the ground. Besides, the tide season, the public space is still a good choice for local
        residents to relax and take a walk.</p>

      <h4 class="grey">we hope our in-and-out design <br>can help the public realize <br>every activity is a part of the social system,<br> shelters without considering about adoption <br>could only solve the problems on the surface</h4>
      <span class="image full"><img src="images/edge-final.png" alt="" /></span>
      <p class="grey">With the increasing number of stray animals, relying solely on the expansion of the size and number of shelters is no longer plausible to solve the problem. Seeming like provide a comfortable home for the stray, it is actually increase the social
        burden, as well as excuse for the animal abandoners. We propose to take adoption as the ultimate goal, aiming to promote virtuous circulation among human and resources, and it contributes to, and finally will, create a lasting and eternal wonderland
        for the stray animals.</p>
