				<h2>_design critique</h2>

				<br>

				<h3>thanks to <a href="http://ruolan.design">Ruolan</a>, <br> we started from design critique <br>on the previous version <br> base on our user research</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<span class="image alt"><img src="images/mobile_critique.png" alt="" /></span>
					<div class="9u$ -3u 12u$(medium)">
						<h4><br>1: unnessary personalization</h4>
						<p>Only functions and information checked here are shown on the personalized some screen.<br>However... Data showed that more than 80% of users didn’t personalize their homescreen frequently because it didn’t matter.Personalization also caused the
							penetration rates of many functions falls. </p>

						<h4><br>2: confused gesture</h4>
						<p>The interface allow users to swipe between home screen, personalization page and setting page quickly.<br>However... Users expressed their confusion to swipe between two screens which are not parallel in terms of function. They also got even more
							frustrated when the gesture of swiping does not apply elsewhere in the application. </p>

						<h4><br>3: levels too deep </h4>
						<p>On home screen, several cards act as the container of information from different category.<br>However... Information could be displayed in cards is limited so that users always need to tap once to see the details. They commented in the interview
							that the steps were tedious and old-fashioned. </p>

						<h4><br>4: interface without enough information</h4>
						<p>Users view their weekly calendar in a table with cells filled by blue.
							<br>However... The penetration rate of weekly calendar was relatively low. It was not because users didn’t need a table view but that the information it tell was deficient. They’d rather check by manully tapping back and ahead on day view.</p>

						<h4><br>conclusion: re-structure needed</h4>
						<p>Although the previous design created an unique experience by cards view, the interface is still hard to learn even for young students. The card didn't work as we thought because the needed information is not shown enough while useless details showed
							a lot.</p>

						<blockquote>"I usually didn't go through all things at a time. I'd rather see only one or two things because that is what I am looking for."</blockquote>

				<h2>_design thinking</h2>
				<h3>after the research, our goal is to redefine <br>the "easy + joyful" experience on Mobile</h3>
				<h3>"easy" is designing for situations and tasks to <br>let users focus on only one thing without noises <br>while "joyful" is something new for student's leisure life
				</h3>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="9u$ -3u 12u$(medium)">
						<p>The most important information for one situation should be specially designed to support users finish related tasks quickly. </p>
						<p>For instance, when users want to check the timetable on the bed or before sleep, theys wish to a full calendar for a day. While an anxious boy standing near a building touching his phone, he wants to know only the classroom number where he should
							be in there in 30 sec.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="9u$ -3u 12u$(medium)">
						<p>We tried to connect the scenario and the IA to make sure users can find things they want in different situations. <br><br> Today is a dashboard with on-going and next things. With some shortcuts, you can even add an assignment linked to a course
							or rate an activity you are in now by one click.
							<br>Calendar has all your things while Discover is a place to fill calendar with fun activities.<br> Also we notice the 5 sec app loading time is unacceptable for the most urgent user so we also provide new ways to show the information - watch
							app and today widget. </p>
